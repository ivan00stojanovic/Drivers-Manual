# [PDM-Prep](https://pdm-prep.netlify.app/)

A web app designed to simulate drivers exams in the state of Pennsylvania, helping people to better prepare for their license.

Questions are stored in a json file and randomly generated for the user, while keeping track of correct and incorrect answers.

Shorthands are also added to give the user better expirence while answering question, instead of relying on mouse movement too much.


# Tech stack

Tech used: HTML, CSS & JS

# Optimizations

While the project is considered finished and completely functional, media queries will be implemented to help people learn on the go!

In addition, another thing that will be added in the near future is end the test when the user gets to 18 or makes too many incorrect decisions, in comparision to now where it can be never-ending, while only keeping track of score.

This will be done via localStorage so that the user can have instant access to his stats and performance in the past, to keep track better
